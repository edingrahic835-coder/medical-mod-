Medical Mod - FULL (Forge 1.20.1)
--------------------------------
This is an expanded mod project scaffold implementing many features discussed:
- Ultrasound device with gel consumption, doppler, freeze, M-mode placeholders, image saving.
- 12-lead EKG (electrodes placement logic scaffolded).
- Heart Monitor device (HR + SpO2, attach/detach to entities, triggers cardiac arrest).
- Defibrillator with pad-attachment logic and shock chance.
- Oxygen mask, CPR interaction, bed block for NPC spawn, movable devices, creative tab.
Note: This project is a complete, compilable Forge project scaffold. Some advanced client-only visuals (animated ultrasound frames, EKG waveform rendering, doppler audio) are scaffolded and marked TODO for future assets.
Build: ./gradlew build  (or use GitHub Actions included)
